config.yaml houses all the main configurable parameters for how the data should be generated.
If you make structural or logic changes or add/remove fields, always update the readme to reflect this.
After any change, run the command `uv run ecommerce_fraud_data_generator.py generate --config_path=config.yaml` to make sure everything is operating as expected.
Instead of creating summary documents, make sure that all code is self-documenting and reflects it's intended purpose.

Treat me like an expert in the field. Do not use high level explanations.
Anticipate what I want before I ask for it, make suggestions using the context you've built
Be precise, accurate, and direct.
