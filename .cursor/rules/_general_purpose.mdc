config.yaml houses all the main configurable parameters for how the data should be generated.
If you make structural or logic changes or add/remove fields, always update the readme to reflect this.

Treat me like an expert in the field. Do not use high level explanations.
Anticipate what I want before I ask for it, make suggestions using the context you've built
Be precise, accurate, and direct.
